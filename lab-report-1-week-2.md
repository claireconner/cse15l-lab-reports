# How to log into a course-specific account on ieng6:

## 1. Installing VScode

## 2. Remotely Connecting
In order to remotely connect, you must first search up your course-specific account on this website: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php. After you have logged in using your username and your student ID, you can use the following command “ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu” to connect to the server– only you must replace “zz” with whatever your account says (mine says “alt”). 


## 3. Trying Some Commands

## 4. Moving Files with scp

## 5. Setting an SSH Key

## 6. Optimizing Remote Running
